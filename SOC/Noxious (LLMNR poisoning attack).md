# Scenario
You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

# Data leak worksheet
**Incident Summary:** During a meeting, a sales manager shared access to a folder containing internal-only documents with their team. This folder included files related to a new, yet-to-be-announced product, along with customer analytics and promotional materials. After the meeting, the manager neglected to revoke access to the folder, although they did caution the team to wait for approval before sharing any promotional materials.

Later, during a video call with a business partner, a member of the sales team forgot the manager’s warning. The sales representative intended to share a link to the promotional materials for the partner to distribute to their customers. Unfortunately, they mistakenly shared the link to the entire internal folder instead. The business partner, believing the link contained only the promotional materials, subsequently posted it on their company’s social media page.
